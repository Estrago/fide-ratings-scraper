# FIDE ratings scrapper

[FIDE](http://ratings.fide.com/) is the International Chess Federation. They have a ratings sub-domain where players can check their international ELO rating (in different categories), their perfomance history, *et cetera*.

This set of JS utility functions (built using NodeJS) aim to provide a sort-of-api to get info from their ratings pages.

I decided to implement this so that I could integrate it in a few of my chess-related projects. Maybe it can help other people in their personal projects as well :+1:.

## Setup

As in any NodeJS application:

```
npm install
```
